# BLEProof-collection
Collection of sample Bluetooth Low Energy applications for iOS, Android, ESP32 and Arduino Nano 33 IoT.

### What they do
The apps implement basic BLE communication:
* Central scans for Peripheral and connects to it
* Central reads a value from Peripheral
* Central writes a value to Peripheral
* Peripheral notifies Central that a value has changed

Each BLE Central is compatible with each BLE Peripheral, because they use the same service and characteristics UUIDs.

### How to run
To run and see it working, you need 2 physical devices supporting Bluetooth Low Energy:
* one device for BLE Central app - Android, iOS, ESP32 or [another supported device](#supported-devices)
* another device for BLE Peripheral app - Android, iOS, ESP32 or [another supported device](#supported-devices)

...and some development tools:
* Android Studio - for Android project
* Xcode - for iOS project
* Arduino IDE [with ESP32 board installed](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) - for ESP32
* Arduino IDE with ArduinoBLE library - [for Arduino Nano 33 IoT](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33IoT)

## Supported devices
Platform | Peripheral | Central | Notes
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Android | YES | YES | Android 5.0 and newer, including Android 12
iOS | YES | YES | iOS 11.0 and newer
ESP32 | YES | YES |  |
Arduino Nano 33 | YES | YES | Tested on Arduino Nano 33 IoT, but should work on any board compatible with ArduinoBLE library

## Table of UUIDs
Name | UUID
----- | ---------------
Service | 25AE1441-05D3-4C5B-8281-93D4E07420CF
Characteristic for read | 25AE1442-05D3-4C5B-8281-93D4E07420CF
Characteristic for write | 25AE1443-05D3-4C5B-8281-93D4E07420CF
Characteristic for indicate | 25AE1444-05D3-4C5B-8281-93D4E07420CF

## BLE Peripheral (all platforms)
Peripheral (also called Slave or Server) works similarly on all platforms:
* Advertises a service with our UUID (see Table of UUIDs)
* The service contains 3 characteristics:
  * for read - has only read permission (see Table of UUIDs)
  * for write - has only write permission (see Table of UUIDs)
  * for indication - supports only indications (see Table of UUIDs)
* Allows the user to change the string value of the characteristic for read
* Allows the user to change the string value of the characteristic for indicate
* Allows the user to send an indication with updated string value to the connected Central

Note 1: technically characteristics can have any amount of permissions (read, write default, write without response, notify, indicate), but in this project each characteristic has only one permission for simplicity.

Note 2: indication is a notification with response - Peripheral notifies, Central confirms that notification received.

## BLE Central (all platforms)
Central (also called Master or Client) works similarly on all platforms:
* Scans for Peripherals which have a service with our UUID (see Table of UUIDs)
* Connects to the first found Peripheral
* Discovers services and characteristics of the connected Peripheral
* Subscribes to indications of the "Characteristic for indicate" (see Table of UUIDs)
* Allows the user to disconnect from Peripheral
* Allows the user to read a characteristic value (string) from Peripheral
* Allows the user to write a characteristic value (string) to Peripheral
